# My Authentication Project

Welcome to **My Authentication Project**! This project is a full-stack application that includes a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js and Express. Below, you'll find instructions to set up and run this project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn**: npm comes with Node.js, but you can also install yarn if you prefer using it. 
- **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-awesome-project.git
   cd my-awesome-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   You'll need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install # or yarn install

   cd ../frontend
   npm install # or yarn install
   ```

## Backend Setup

1. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and set the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` and `your_jwt_secret_key` with your actual MongoDB connection string and a secret key for JWT.

2. **Database Setup:**

   Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas. The connection string should be set in the `.env` file as shown above.

3. **Running the Backend:**

   To start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev # or yarn dev
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and set the following variable:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

   This will ensure that your React app communicates with the backend.

2. **Running the Frontend:**

   To start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start # or yarn start
   ```

   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Project

After setting up both the backend and frontend, the project should be fully operational.

1. **Start the Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev # or yarn dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start # or yarn start
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the application running.

## Environment Variables

### Backend

- **PORT**: The port number the server will run on.
- **MONGO_URI**: MongoDB connection string.
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for signing JWTs.

### Frontend

- **REACT_APP_API_URL**: The base URL for the API (backend server).

## Common Issues

- **Port Conflicts**: If the default ports (`5000` for backend, `3000` for frontend) are already in use, change the ports in the `.env` files and update the `package.json` scripts.
- **CORS Issues**: If you encounter CORS issues, ensure that your backend is properly configured to accept requests from the frontend.
- **Database Connection**: Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible. Double-check the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file.
